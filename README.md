# Krypto Game Webapp

This is a simple game project created by me, Jack Huang, to practice working with React.

## How to Play:

In real life, Krypto is a card game often played as a game of speed against other people, pitting each other's mental math skills to the test.

### Initial / Set up
Initially, five cards are flipped face-up. Card values of 2-10 are their number value. Jacks are worth 11, Queens 12, Kings 13, and Aces are 1 or 14.
Once the five cards are flipped face-up and players are ready, a "target" card is flipped up.

### Rules of play

The first person who is able to use all five cards through combinations of mathematical operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) and achieve a value of the target card wins. Order of operations must be followed and all cards must be used. Aside from that, any combination of the operations can be used, solong as all five cards are used to achieve the target.
